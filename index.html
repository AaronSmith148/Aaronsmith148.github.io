                    Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Aaron Smith, and I am a passionate software developer with a focus on system and gameplay design.
                    Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working on various projects that have allowed me to showcase my creativity, teamwork, dedication,
                    and innovation. With a strong foundation in programming languages and design principles, I am always seeking to expand my knowledge and push the
                    boundaries of what's possible in the industry. I take pride in collaborating with teams of all sizes to bring ideas to life, and I am committed to
                    delivering projects that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. As you explore my portfolio, I hope to convey my love for programming
                    and the exciting possibilities that can arise from taking on challenging projects. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Here</a> is an

                    Project Castle was the first personal project I ever created. It is a top down, point and click RPG demo featuring combat, animation, and cinematics.
                    Following a tutorial series, I was able to create a play area, build a control set, create state machines for AI, and use cinemachine cinematics.
                    During this process, I learned a lot about what it means to drive yourself when there is no pressure. If i didnt make this demo, I wouldnt be fired,
                    I wouldn't get a failing grade, it just wouldn't exist. But when it came down to it, my passion and the desire to learn pushed me through and I made
                    a small demo that I am pround of the look and feel of.

                    Dragon Ascent is an interactive comic book built in unity by myself and a group of 3 other students. Our objective was to tell a story around the prompt
                    “The universe is an illusion created in the mind.” To do this we built several layers into the storytelling of the game. The first is the reality of the 
                    villagers, who believe the dragon to be real and live in fear of it. The second layer is the reality of the hero, who know the dragon is not real and was
                    created by the villagers. The third level is the game reality, where the hero, the villagers, and the world are not real, and are constructs for
                    entertainment. The fourth level is the 3D reality, where the player of the Dragon’s Ascent game exists and interacts with the game reality. The final 
                    level is our reality, where the reader of the comic experiences everything below, seeing how each layer interacts.

                    Skills wise, this project pushed me, as it was mostly revolved mostly around art. However, we were able to use an agile methodology to assign roles and built our
                    team around the individuals skills. I acted as Scrum Master and lead programmer, creating the layout and functionality of the book, as well as the inbuilt gameplay
                    sections where the player has control of the character. I learned a lot more however in the role of Scrum Master. Between school breaks, technology issues, and 
                    and the different complexity of tasks, I spent a lot of the week messaging group members to delegate tasks, assist in solving problems, and providing feedback
                    rather than doing direct work on the project. I had to grow a lot of my interpersonal skills to make sure that no matter what happened, my team knew we would be able
                    to handle it.
